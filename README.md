# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-Project
Name: Blake Love
This project was conducted in order to implement an array of concepts such as data structures, including arrays, stacks, queues, lists, trees, strings, graphs, and files.
This project was also done along side two partners Peyton deboer and Susie. 
Overall concept on the project:
•	Using fundamental concepts and abstractions of data structures, including arrays, stacks, queues, lists, trees, strings, graphs, and files.
•	Designed and analyzed algorithms for efficient data manipulation and problem-solving.
•	Implemented a project utilizing linked lists, hash functions, and sorted lists to process file data.
•	Conducted performance testing on Replit to evaluate and compare algorithm efficiency
